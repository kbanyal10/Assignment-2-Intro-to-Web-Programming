# COMP 1006 - ASSIGNMENT:2
ACADEMIC SUCCESS
This web application is made by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, 
and PDO Libraries. This application shows the academic status od every student. We can 
register ourselves to this website and then you can log in into it to change
the student information. But if you are not registered then you can only 
see the information. This uses server-side scripting and thus works on the session. 




Its live link is http://aws.computerstudi.es/~gc200395834/ASSIGNMENT%20_%202/Homepage.php.
